## [7.1.0] - 2019-06-08

### Changed

-   Turned off `<arg name="basepath" value="./"/>` in phpcs.xml to avoid the VSCode PHPCS plugin from missing code smells. Missed the root level and plugin phpcs.xml files.
    -   Until the plugin is fixed we have to remove `basepath`.

## [7.0.0] - 2019-03-24

### Changed

-   Updated wp-foundation-six-php to v3.0.0
    -   Updated PHP from v7.2 to v7.3 [release notes](http://php.net/releases/7_3_0.php)
    -   Updated xDebug to v2.7.0 [release notes](https://xdebug.org/updates.php)
    -   Reference the [PHP end of life chart](http://php.net/supported-versions.php)
-   Updated general-cli to v2.0.0
    -   Updated PHP from v7.2 to v7.3 [release notes](http://php.net/releases/7_3_0.php)
-   Updated composer packages
-   Updated npm modules
-   Turned off `<arg name="basepath" value="./"/>` in phpcs.xml to avoid the VSCode PHPCS plugin from missing code smells. The plugin is expecting the full path to the file being sniffed and having `basepath` in phpcs.xml breaks the file lookup.
    -   Until the plugin is fixed we have to remove `basepath`.
-   Turned off sass-lint indentation rule, it's being handled by Prettier
-   Reduced the number of named tasks in gulpfile
-   Used short jquery-migrate import in the `global-scripts.js` file
-   Removed the `content-formatting.php` function that was removing the auto paragraph functionality in core WordPress.
    -   This function turned off the `autop` and text formatting that WordPress would do by default. This was to allow us to nest short-codes with spaces and returns without having paragraph tags being created. This broke recently and has been causing trouble. Iâ€™ve decided to remove this to avoid future issues. You will have to place your short-codes directly next to each other.
-   Adjusted search form template to better associate search label and inputs
-   Adjusted default colors to pass accessibility contrast test
-   Adjusted template headings to have the correct HTML headers
-   Added missing search results meta description

### Added

-   Added .todo, .log, and .logs to the --build ignore list in `gulpfile.babel.js`
-   Added --skip_lint argument to gulp lint tasks
    -   This was added to speed up the ejection and build tasks. When working on the theme you are still expected to run the linting tasks, however, when building and ejecting this is not required.
    -   More specifically the phpcs and prettier tasks will be skipped. The eslint process is being handled by webpack and will not be skipped.
-   Added imageminMozjpeg, imageminGifsicle, and imageminSvgo npm modules to images task
    -   The images will be further optimized. If the current setting over optimize please look in the `gulpfile.babel.js` file at the theme level and adjust the image tasks setting to whichever best fits your needs
-   Added plumber to gulp images task to prevent errors from stopping task.
    -   In previous versions of the image task if an image caused this task to error out the watch and serve tasks would stop. This should not longer be the case.
-   Added feature checks in modernizr config
    -   See the `modernizr-config.json` file in the theme to see the additions
-   Added archive, index, and search post pagination.

## [5.0.0] - 2018-08-25

### Added

-   Integrated Prettier
    -   eslint-config-prettier npm package
        -   Turns off eslint all rules that are unnecessary or might conflict with Prettier.
    -   eslint-plugin-prettier npm package
        -   Runs Prettier as an ESLint rule and reports differences as individual ESLint issues.
    -   prettier npm package
        -   Prettier is an opinionated code formatter. It enforces a consistent style by parsing your code and re-printing it with its own rules that take the maximum line length into account, wrapping code when necessary.
    -   Prettier ignore file
    -   Prettier configurations file

### Changed

-   .eslintrc
    -   Simplified rules, many were already set in the recommended standards.
    -   Added Prettier configurations.
    -   Set ecmaVersion to v8.
-   gulpfile.babel.js
    -   Formatting changes for Prettier.
    -   Updated ignores list on copy task for the new Prettier config files.
-   Ran Prettier on all JavaScript files
-   Ran Prettier on all SCSS files
    -   Needed a `// prettier-ignore` line above `// sass-lint:disable-line no-ids` to prevent the ignore line from dropping to the next line.
        -   You'll have to watch out for this in the future when using Prettier and disabling a single line with sass-lint. The comment needs to remain on the same line; to do this and use Prettier we need the prettier-ignore line above the sass-lint line.
        -   This change was made to the \_generic-styles.scss file.
-   On some markdown files Prettier can make a mess of things if you have long links. For this reason the README.md in the sass directory has a new line: `<!-- prettier-ignore -->`, to prevent Prettier from messing up the formatting.
-   In the sass-lint.yml file, the setting for brace-style has been changed.
