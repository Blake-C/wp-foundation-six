The WordPress Foundation 6 Developer Framework is meant to be a starting point for developers to create projects without having third party code/modules within their git repo. This project uses [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) to install [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) and default plugins as project dependencies. The base theme uses [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) to install script dependencies, and [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) as the build system. Gulp also uses [Babel](http://babeljs.io/) and [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) to transpile ES6/ES2015 to ES5 so that you can use the latest [ECMAScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript) syntax.
