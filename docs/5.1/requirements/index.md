![Docker logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Blake-C/docs/master/static_files/docker-logo-v2.png "Docker")

If you will be using the provided docker services all you need on your host machine is docker:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
	- [Download Docker](https://store.docker.com/search?offering=community&type=edition)

This project provides a docker container called `general-cli`, the general-cli container provides all the command line tools required to build the project and theme in the proceeding pages.

---

To use this project without the general cli container/service you'll need to install the following on your local machine.

- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)
	- [WordPress Packagist](https://wpackagist.org/) <- Used with Composer
- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/)

If you plan not to use docker altogether here are some options for AMP stacks

- [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/en/)
	- If you're on Mac I'd suggest [MAMP Pro](https://www.mamp.info/en/mamp-pro/)
- [WAMP](http://www.wampserver.com/en/)
- [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html)
- [AMPPS](http://www.ampps.com/)
