### Unit Test Data

If you need unit test data to work with you can download it from here:

- [Theme Unit Test Data](https://wpcom-themes.svn.automattic.com/demo/theme-unit-test-data.xml)
- [More info can be found here](https://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Unit_Test)

### WP Foundation Six - Plugin

This project includes a base plugin with a sample custom post type. You can use this plugin to add features that do not need to be added to the theme. For the custom post type file replace any sample text with your custom post types data. If a feature is large enough consider moving it to its own plugin directory.

### What Now?

- In the `public_html/wp-content/themes/wp-foundation-six/style.css` file you will need to update the theme name and other settings.
- Update your app icons using [Favicon Generator](http://realfavicongenerator.net/)
- Think about optimizing the load order of your scripts and how you might be able to combine files for fewer http requests.
- Carefully organize your [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) so that other developers can understand your code.
- Read the [Foundation Documentation](http://foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs/)
- Read the [Sass Documentation](http://sass-lang.com/guide)
- Ask question and contribute ideas!
