	☐	Find a away to run Prettier when JS/SCSS files have been saved while gulp is running. @created(Sun 09.23.2018 05:44:43 PM)
		We can not do this with npm scripts since that will only trigger Prettier once at the start.
		Prettier will need to run with gulp when JS/SCSS files as they are saved.
			Or with Webpack if we only want to run Prettier on JS files.
	☐	Consider adding semicolons back to Prettier/ESLint @created(Sun 09.23.2018 05:51:19 PM)
