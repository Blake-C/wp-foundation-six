TODO:
	☐	Find a way to run Prettier when JS/SCSS files have been saved while gulp is running. @created(Sun 09.23.2018 05:44:43 PM)
			We can not do this with NPM scripts since that will only trigger Prettier once at the start.
			Prettier will need to run with gulp when JS/SCSS files as they are saved.
				Or with Webpack if we only want to run Prettier on JS files.
	☐	Consider adding semicolons back to Prettier/ESLint @created(Sun 09.23.2018 05:51:19 PM)
			Let's see how things work out on the next few projects and decide on that on if we keep the current configurations or add semicolons back.
